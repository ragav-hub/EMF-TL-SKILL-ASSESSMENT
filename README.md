# 3 DB ATTENUATOR

# INTRODUCTION:
A 3 dB attenuator is a passive RF / microwave circuit used to reduce signal power by 3 decibels, i.e., to one-half of its original power level. It is widely used in communication, measurement, and microwave systems to control signal levels, protect sensitive devices, and improve impedance matching.

A 3 dB attenuator can be implemented using different resistor networks (L-pad, T-type, Π-type) designed for a given characteristic impedance (usually 50 Ω or 75 Ω). Like the Standing Waves & SWR report in your EMT&TL material, this document explains the basic theory, design equations, measurement techniques, applications, and key references
